    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    
    <section>
      <h2>What Is This?</h2>
      <p>
        The Thucydides Daily Reader is a 507-day journey through one of history's most important texts: 
        Thucydides' <em>History of the Peloponnesian War</em>. <br><br>
        Written in the 5th century BCE, this work chronicles the conflict between Athens and Sparta that reshaped the ancient Greek world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than presenting the complete text at once, this project releases one passage per day, 
        beginning November 27, 2025. <br><br>
        Each passage is enriched with modern translation, historical context, scholarly annotations, and connections to other ancient sources.<br><br>
        Taking "Thucydides on War" at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIS_Europe" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAIS Bologna Center</a> was one of the richest intellectual experiences I've had the fortune to savor. I want to share my passion for this book with the world at large, and encourage more people to engage with Thucydides.

      <h2>Why Thucydides?</h2>
      <p>
        Thucydides is often called the first "scientific" historian. Unlike his predecessors, he:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rejected mythological explanations in favor of rational analysis</li>
        <li>Investigated underlying causes rather than accepting surface narratives</li>
        <li>Sought eyewitness testimony and tested evidence</li>
        <li>Examined human nature and power dynamics with an attuned appreciation for psychology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        His work remains relevant today, and will in perpetuity.<br><br> 
        The Peloponnesian War offers lessons about imperial overreach, democratic fragility, leadership failures, and the human costs of conflict that resonate across millennia.

      <h2>How It Was Made</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses AI (Claude by Anthropic) to enrich the public domain Crawley translation 
        with modern scholarly insights. The enrichment process involved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parsing the complete text into 507 manageable daily passages</li>
        <li>Generating sophisticated modern translations that preserve Thucydides' style</li>
        <li>Adding historical context drawn from contemporary scholarship</li>
        <li>Identifying connections to other ancient sources</li>
        <li>Creating thematic links across the entire work</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      <h2>Why Read It Daily?</h2>
      <p>
        The daily format serves several purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Digestibility:</strong> Breaking the History into 507 passages makes this 
          challenging text manageable, even for busy readers
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contemplation:</strong> Time between passages allows for reflection on themes 
          and parallels to contemporary events
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community:</strong> A shared reading schedule creates a community of readers 
          moving through the text together
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cumulative understanding:</strong> Daily engagement builds familiarity with 
          Thucydides' cast of characters and the complex web of alliances and conflicts
        </li>
      </ul>
